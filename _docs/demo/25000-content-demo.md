# 25000 content demo

The 25000 content demo and test repository demonstrates a business setup of sensenet for a project with a bunch of example content to try out its capabilities. It provides a good insight into the content structure of a medium size project giving the opportunity to verify the functionality with making a proof of concept trying out the API and the admin surface. This enviroment is based on a daily build which means all the built-in demo content are reimported, the configurations are restored and the customer-created stuff are removed every day.

The document libraries mainly contain Microsoft Office word, excel and powerpoint files, pdf's and some simple text files. They're not only showing variety of types but also are written in different languages, so you're able to check out search capabitities with special characters and symbols as well.

Document preview generation is switched on in this repository and as it is configured in the built-in setting, two preview images will be generated in one round. The first two pages of the demo files are automatically generated when the repository is created.

**Number of content**: There're TODO: 982 items excluding and TODO: 2375 including system content in the top level container named Content (/Root/Content). In the first case System Folders (e.g. local groups) and Preview images don't count.

**Size of the db**: This demo enviroment gives us an insight into the possible storage needs of a repository as well:

TODO:

#### Whole database

|                |   |
| -------------- | - |
| **Db size** [ALLOCATED] | 37 200 MB (33Gb db + 4Gb log) |
| **Db size** [USED] | 18 420 MB |
| **Files table** | 2Â 551 MB |
| **Versions table** | 15 816 MB |

#### In the Content subtree (size, binary+indexdoc)
