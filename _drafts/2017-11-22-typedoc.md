Working on a development platform is not only though because we have to create stuff that fits all developer-needs, but because we have to provide tons of documentation. Our main goal is to make developers lifes easier, so we have to help them with useable and easy-to-follow docs consequently both at the first steps and on the expert level too. Learn how we've manage this situation.

Since most of us at sensenet are developers, we thought right from the start that the documentation should be something auto-generated. On one hand because we have to keep it always up-to-date, on the other hand because this way generating documentation would be the part of our daily build process and we can work on the code and the documentation at the same place. Since there're several ways to generate API documentation from the code comments on the backend, we tried to figure out a common way to do the same with the client-side code. 

First there was the idea of a custom, in-house doc-generator tool that generates API references from the code comments from both the backend and the frontend code at the same time. We thougth that our software's (sensenet ECM) will be the perfect place to publish this docs as contents, so we started to write the generator...

..and yes, we realized surprisingly fast that it is a huge amount of work and it's not worth it. There must be a tool for that we should digg us deeper to find it. It seemed easier to forget the ultimate generator and try to focus on the frontend docs separately.

Our client-side code is mainly written in JavaScript (actually in TypeScript but leave it till later) and JSDoc was already a known
