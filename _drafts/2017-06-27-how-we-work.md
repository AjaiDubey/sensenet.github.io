# See how Sense/Net Inc project team work with one of our clients directly

From time to time we have a direct agreement with our customers. By this work connection client&#39;s doubts, confusions and expectations can be examined the best. As an ECM vendor, working customers directly are highly valued but the number of them is limited (because most of the time our partners do it). Customers turn to us when they have a complex [intranet project](https://www.sensenet.com/for-customers/use-cases/intranet), [document management](https://www.sensenet.com/for-customers/use-cases/document-management) issue or want to utilize our [headless EMC](https://www.sensenet.com/for-customers/use-cases/content-repository) for the best.

Although to work with clients are sometimes a challenge, especially because of their desperate background, but cultural, time zone and technology differences give us extra learning experience.

Let us to give you a short overview how we try to focus on and make our customers happy during those projects.

## We are agile – better solution sooner

Here you are some short stories about how we would like to work with you, if we have a common project. During the sales conversation, we lay down the project framework and have a common understanding what we&#39;d like to reach (overall outcome, features, etc.). Our company uses SCRUM and we encourage our customers to have this common &quot;working language&quot; to make the project successful.

## Minimum Viable Product

First of all, we need to set up the Minimum Viable Product: this is the minimum processes and functions for releasing the product. Generally, the story mapping method is used: in the rows are weeks/sprints/months, and in the columns are the functions. Now we are using google spreadsheet (with direct email address sharing: it&#39;s easy reach from every platform), where we can collaborate, and manage the information. The important functions are put on the top of the rows, while less major are keep below – this is the way we set the priority (usually during a common meeting with the client).

Some description of this method are found on this link: [https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2013/august/creating-an-agile-roadmap-using-story-mapping](https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2013/august/creating-an-agile-roadmap-using-story-mapping)

## The Backlog

After creating the story mapping we usually start to write a backlog – together with the client. We use the story mapping table, where the top functions are copied and start to write the details.

It&#39;s the same google spreadsheet, so you have to mark only one URL. (Side note: our JIRA system is under upgrading, in the future we will handle the backlog there – so really waiting for that upgrading :) )

In the spreadsheet there are just a few columns in one row:
- Function ID number (from the contract)
-- It helps us to check which are the extra Change request functions, and which were in the original contract.
-- Yes, that&#39;s true we track all the new requests that are extras –however we have to measure our promising, so not everything can be developed during our common work without contract extension
- Story name, description and acceptance criteria&#39;s
- Story points and status
- Comment field: just an URL link from another system, where everything can be discussed – in the backlog we just write the cleared and validated story fields
-- We use the basecamp system ( [https://3.basecamp.com](https://3.basecamp.com/)) to plan the functions, and add access to every stakeholder of the project

## Refinement, story points, release burnup

If we have enough story, we organize an inner meeting with the SCRUM team, and refine the stories: collect questions, estimate story points, split stories.

This meeting – write stories with the client and refine these by the SCRUM team – goes every week till the project goes. That is the time for &quot;soft&quot; debates where client and SCRUM team try to convince each other :).

If we have story points for every task we create a release burnup chart to estimate the future: it contains the future sprint numbers, the actual story points in the backlog, and calculate a forecast for the future based on the velocity. If we have 300 story points in the backlog, and 20 story point/sprint can be done we will finish the whole backlog in 15 sprints – that&#39;s a usually forecast. But it&#39;s important to calculate a best case and a worst case forecast too, we usually multiply the velocity with 1,1 and 0,9: in the worst case just 18 SP-s in one sprint can be done, so we will finish just in 17 sprints.

You can see the details here: [http://agilewhys.blogspot.hu/2015/03/how-to-create-release-burn-up-chart.html](http://agilewhys.blogspot.hu/2015/03/how-to-create-release-burn-up-chart.html)

## Big Wall – when we recognize the time is limited

Sometimes we have so many tasks and stories which make the priority more difficult so it&#39;s a good way to stop, and reorder and re-estimate the backlog: we use the Big Wall technique. We print all of stories to little papers with the story points (post-it size), and create a big whiteboard chart: axis X is the size of the backlog item, Y is the value. First step is put the papers to the wall: it&#39;s the SCRUM team task. The biggest tasks are on the right side, the smallest ones are on the left side. After all of them are on the table we draw straight lines which should cross as many stories as they can: so we have to think over these stories&#39; sizes. Finally there will be columns with the refactored story point: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13…

The next step belongs to the customer: they have to organize the papers between bottom and top: the most valuable items are on the top, the less valuable ones are on the bottom.

Last step we cut the whole whiteboard to four parts in the middle:
1. Small task but valuables
2. Big task but valuables
3. Small task but not so valuables
4. Big task and not so valuables

These four categories help you to reorder the backlog!

## NFR – Non Functional Requirements

There is another important stage to create the product what the customer expects: the non-functional requirements. We know the business requirements, that for example they need some searching function, but the non-functional requirements tell us how fast, in how many information have to search, what happens when the connection is slow, ect. there are more than 35 areas what we check in the beginning of the project: performance, IT security, speed, disaster recovery, etc. Each of them can be as important as functional requirements so we never underestimate these needs.

## DOD – Definition of Done

After checking all items in the NFR list we must define what means &quot;Done&quot;, what is a ready function? It&#39;s a list of actions we must do after every backlog item. It can contain the type of the browsers type and versions, the role settings, log requirements, verification methods, etc. It helps us to avoid childish mistakes and perform consistently great in every phase of the project.

## CONCLUSION

The stories about the projects can be continued but that&#39;s enough for today  We&#39;ve learnt from the past to set up the expectations with the clients at the beginning to have fruitful relationship without too many unmanageable debates. Honest and professional conversations lead us to a successful project and it gives the smile to our clients&#39; face 

Sense/Net Inc. teaches the partners for the same value and commitment towards our common customers.
